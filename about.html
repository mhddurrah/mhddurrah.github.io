## About

Being a software engineer means that you must be as flexible as possible to keep up with new technologies.

Very good experience with Java EE technologies; from JSF (including primefaces), Hibernate, Web-services, to EJB, also with xml and advanced javascript using OOP and RaphaÃ«l JS.
I have been working as a php developer with multiple frameworks starting from wordpress, magento, to new MVC frameworks; Laravel and YII, with MongoDB, also I made several Android applications.

I am enthusiastic to java technologies and jvm languages in general, Vert.x, scala, spark and hadoop.

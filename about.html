## About

Being a software engineer means that you must be as flexible as possible to keep up with new technologies.

Having five years of experience, though it is a short period, pushed me many steps towards proficiency in a wide range of technologies.

Working for about 3 years as a software developer in Invest4all provided me with a great experience with Java EE technologies; from JSF (including primefaces), Hibernate, Web-services, to EJB, also with xml and advanced javascript using OOP and RaphaÃ«l JS.

Alongside my work as a java developer, I have been working as a php developer with multiple frameworks starting from wordpress, magento, to new MVC frameworks; Laravel and YII, with MongoDB, also I made several Android applications.

I am enthusiastic to java technologies and jvm languages in general, Vert.x, scala, spark and hadoop.
Specialities: Java, JSF, Hibernate, EJB, OSGi, Android, Wordpress, Laravel
